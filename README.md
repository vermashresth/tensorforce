#### Introduction

Tensorforce is an open-source deep reinforcement learning framework, with an emphasis on modularized flexible library design and straightforward usability for applications in research and practice. Tensorforce is built on top of [Google's TensorFlow framework](https://www.tensorflow.org/) and compatible with Python 3 (Python 2 support was dropped with version 0.5).

Tensorforce follows a set of high-level design choices which differentiate it from other similar libraries:

- **Modular component-based design**: Feature implementations, above all, strive to be as generally applicable and configurable as possible, potentially at some cost of faithfully resembling details of the introducing paper.
- **Separation of RL algorithm and application**: Algorithms are agnostic to the type and structure of inputs (states/observations) and outputs (actions/decisions), as well as the interaction with the application environment.
- **Full-on TensorFlow models**: The entire reinforcement learning logic, including control flow, is implemented in TensorFlow, to enable portable computation graphs independent of application programming language, and to facilitate the deployment of models.

## Installation


A stable version of Tensorforce is periodically updated on PyPI and installed as follows:

```bash
pip install tensorforce
```

To always use the latest version of Tensorforce, install the GitHub version instead:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tensorforce/tensorforce.git
cd tensorforce
pip install -e .
```

Tensorforce is built on top of [Google's TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) and requires that either `tensorflow` or `tensorflow-gpu` is installed, currently as version `1.13.1`. To include the correct version of TensorFlow with the installation of Tensorforce, simply add the flag `tf` for the normal CPU version or `tf_gpu` for the GPU version:

```bash
# PyPI version plus TensorFlow CPU version
pip install tensorforce[tf]

# GitHub version plus TensorFlow GPU version
pip install -e .[tf_gpu]
```

Some environments require additional packages, for which there are also options available (`mazeexp`, `gym`, `retro`, `vizdoom`; or `envs` for all environments), however, some require other tools to be installed (see [environments documentation](http://tensorforce.readthedocs.io)).



## Quickstart example code

```python
from tensorforce.agents import Agent

# Instantiate a Tensorforce agent
agent = Agent.create(
    agent='tensorforce',
    states=dict(type='float', shape=(10,)),
    actions=dict(type='int', num_values=5),
    memory=10000,
    update=dict(unit='timesteps', batch_size=64),
    optimizer=dict(type='adam', learning_rate=3e-4),
    policy=dict(network='auto'),
    objective='policy_gradient',
    reward_estimation=dict(horizon=20)
)

# Initialize the agent
agent.initialize()

# Retrieve the latest (observable) environment state
state = get_current_state()  # (float array of shape [10])

# Query the agent for its action decision
action = agent.act(states=state)  # (scalar between 0 and 4)

# Execute the decision and retrieve the current performance score
reward = execute_decision(action)  # (any scalar float)

# Pass feedback about performance (and termination) to the agent
agent.observe(reward=reward, terminal=False)
```



## Command line usage

Tensorforce comes with a range of [example configurations](https://github.com/tensorforce/tensorforce/tree/master/benchmarks/configs) for different popular reinforcement learning environments. For instance, to run Tensorforce's implementation of the popular [Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06347) on the [OpenAI Gym CartPole environment](https://gym.openai.com/envs/CartPole-v1/), execute the following line:

```bash
python run.py benchmarks/configs/ppo.json gym --level CartPole-v1 -e 300
```

## Features

- **Neural network layers**: Dense fully-connected layer, embedding layer, 1- and 2-dimensional convolution, pooling, LSTM, activation, dropout, normalization, and more; *plus* support of Keras layers.
- **Memory types**: Simple batch buffer memory, random replay memory.
- **Policy distributions**: Bernoulli distribution for boolean actions, categorical distribution for (finite) integer actions, Gaussian distribution for continuous actions, Beta distribution for range-constrained continuous actions.
- **Optimization algorithms**: Various gradient-based optimizers provided by TensorFlow like Adam/AdaDelta/Momentum/RMSProp/etc, evolutionary optimizer, natural-gradient-based optimizer, plus a range of meta-optimizers.
- **Execution modes**: Parallel execution, distributed execution.
- **Other features**: state/reward preprocessing, exploration, variable noise, regularization losses.
- **TensorBoard support**.

By combining these modular components in different ways, a variety of popular deep reinforcement learning models/features can be replicated: [Deep Q-learning (DQN)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5602) and variations like [Double-DQN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.06461) or [Deep Q-learning from Demonstrations (DQfD)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.03732), [vanilla policy-gradient algorithm / REINFORCE](http://www-anw.cs.umass.edu/~barto/courses/cs687/williams92simple.pdf), [Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06347), [Actor-critic and A3C](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.01783), [Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.05477), [Normalised Advantage Function (NAF)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.00748), [Generalized Advantage estimation (GAE)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02438), etc.

Note that in general the replication is not 100% faithful, since the models as described in the corresponding paper often involve additional minor tweaks and modifications which are hard to support with a modular design (and, arguably, also questionable whether it is important/desirable to support them). On the upside, these models are just a few examples from the multitude of module combinations supported by Tensorforce.
